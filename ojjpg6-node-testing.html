This question might be a bit broad question my javascript/DOM knowledge isn't great. I'm doing some automation/unit testing on javascript using mocha-phantomjs, chai and sinon. I'm on my mobile at the moment so I can't provide any examples of the code I'm writing but it's using 4 files one html page that contains links to 3 scripts 2 files I'm testing and 1 which is running the tests. It's very similar to the nettuts tutorial on mocha-phantomjs. The issue is I'm trying to prove an alert.
