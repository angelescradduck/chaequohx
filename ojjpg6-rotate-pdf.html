Hey everyone, I've created PyPDF Builder (https://github.com/mrgnth/PyPDF-Builder) and am interested in feedback from the community. This project is inspired by Angus Johnson's PDFTK Builder, which is only available for Windows. Its goal is a GUI that builds on PyPDF2 as well as other PDF related libraries and offers a unified and simple experience for end-users on all desktop platforms: PyPDF Builder Screenshot (https://i.redd.it/y0t8xmd630611.png) I've bundled a first binary release

I'm no absolutely certain if this is the correct place to ask this so please redirect me if necessary. So we have been trying to remove Adobe Professional from our environment because the after surveying our users, we realised that MS Word satisfied most of their needs. Another small subset of usera used it to simply rotate PDFs. For that second group of users we were looking for a tool to do that for them. Management would like a tool similar to those online tools where Как пользоваться VirtualDub  У VirtualDub практически такие же функции, как и у любого другого редактора. I like the native PDF viewer/annotation in iOS 11, but Apple seems to have left out one really obvious feature (unless I’m just dumb and can’t find it). How do you rotate PDFs, e.g. for landscape into portrait mode? I’m thinking of text documents were the text is sideways or upside down and you need to rotate it and save it that way. Any help appreciated. 
On PC, you can rotate PDF files so that they're in the correct orientation for reading. On Android, the best I've found you can do is lock your phone's orientation, causing me to read with my phone upside down in some cases. Apps I've tried: Adobe Acrobat Reader (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adobe.reader) Google PDF Viewer (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.pdfviewer) Foxit PDF Reader amp Editor (https://play.google.com/store/. Right click -gt Picture -gt Rotate clockwise If I follow above step, "smart" algorithm will rotate the page but not the text. But I want the text rotated by 90 degrees too, because the PDF I work with are intended to be used in paper and often have text rotated by 90 degree. I have read the FAQ and Googled, but haven't come up with anything. I don't produce PDF documents. However, many times people will fax me documents that come in as a PDF through a third party service. I need to be able to do two simple things: Split a PDF into multiple pages (for example, a six page fax that just came in needs to be split into page 1, page 2, page 3-5, and page 6) Rotate pages that are faxed upside down AND SAVE THEM LIKE THAT. I have an old version of Adobe Acrobat. Hello, I'm fairly new to ios and my company decided to buy ipads for a bunch of people. I have this issue with multipage pdf files and one of the scanned pages was first printed in landscape. now while viewing the file, everything is ok except those pages which are 1/4 turn in the wrong direction. Apparently none of the viewers i've tested (iOs builtin viewer, acrobat, airwatch, foxit) have an easy way to rotate the display. The only thing I've found was with foxit, where I need rotate. I've searched for the answer to, what I originally assumed would be an easy question but so far I've come up short. I did find this help page ( but I can't get this to work. I'm guessing I'm doing something wrong? Can anyone elaborate on how to rotate pdfs I've already imported into Evernote? Thanks 
Maybe I am loosing my mind here, because when looking up "rotating a pdf file" in Google I basically have these options. 1) Upload my document to some shady website to rotate it. (I'm sure they don't keep your data ;-) 2) Download some 3rd party app that is probably full of bloat / spyware / downloader toolbar etc which watermarks the document unless you buy the full version. 3) Buy a ,000 mac that can apparently do this out of the box with preview mode. 4) PAY A SUBSCRIPTION to adobe. Is anyone else unable to click certain buttons towards the top of the screen like the notifications button on facebook and rotate pdf in pdf viewer? Its only started happening with the new update. I can click bookmarks, url bar, extensions. Announcing the launch of our new PDF tools product - https://pdfgarage.com (https://pdfgarage.com). PDFGarage is one stop shop for all your PDF needs.

I followed the answer given on StackExchange (https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/24738/how-do-i-rotate-pages-in-pdf-tools/24743#24743), but did not succed. After installing `pdftk` and yanking the code snippet listed (at StackExchange) into my `init.el`, I got the following message when I tried to rotate a pdf in pdf-view-mode by pressing `r` Revert buffer from file /path/to/pdf.pdf? (y or n) And when I press `y` or `n`, nothing happens. I am on macos mojave. How to solve this?. Preview perfectly embodies what I love about macOS and hate about Windows: built-in software that works great and doesn't require me to waste time searching for 3rd party solutions on the web. Preview can open damn near any file type. Preview can combine/edit/draw/rotate PDFs like a champ. Meanwhile I just spent 30 minutes on my Windows 10 machine trying to simply combine two PDFs and re-order the pages (it turns out you can't do this with either the W10 app OR Adobe without paying UnitePDF is a free app which provides various converters under one roof.

I have one page within a pdf with a wrong orientation and I would like to rotate it to correct the orientation on my iPhone and iPad. I need to send the pdf so “rotate” your device doesn’t. I'll omit my sheer amazement that Microsoft didn't install a rough-and-ready PDF editor by default here. So far, the options I've found are: Adobe subscription (£13 per month just to rotate a page now and then, sorry but it is out of the question) Foxit Phantom Standard that's it I'm interested in any suggestions. I cannot go back to the Mac, I hated it, but will if I cannot get this sorted out. It's a deal-breaker since I scan my hand-notes in on a regular basis, and I really 
I've seen some PDF files where the actual page is rotated 90 degrees, so that when looking at it on the screen one doesn't have to tilt to view it. I have seen things like landcape in latex, but this just formats the text so that it's printed landscape, i want the actual page to be rotated 90 degrees. for example here the third page is rotated : https://i.imgur.com/NlgalCO.png , rather than just having the text formatted in landscape. Thanks. I work at a tech desk for a major US university that supports all students and staff. We strive to educate users while they're receiving help as to prevent repeat visits, yet there are a few regulars who see us as a personal resource. Today, I had a student come in asking for help to "turn her screen back around because it's stuck upside down". Intreagued, I asked her to show me. Sure enough, she had managed to configure OS X to display completly upside down (typically reserved for external. So my Scanner isn't working properly, so all my scanned documents are skew. Is there any program, that can compensate for that error and rotate it, so that it isn't skew anymore? Or a program, where i can do that manually? (preferable a free program or not expensive one) Checked the whole internet for half an hour and couldn't find any programs or solution to my problem.
